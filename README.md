# Configuring Docker using Ansible
> configure Docker in RPM based distro.
## Basic Functionality:
  * Pull Docker Images.
  * Run Docker Container.
  * Publish port.
  * Mount volumes in Docker container.

## Progress:
  currently working on replacing all changable strings to variable.

## Future Improvements:
  I'll try to use a seprate file for storing variables to improve readabilty.
